A web application for selling clothing and fashion accessories. Guests can browse the product catalog, view images, sizes, and prices, while registered users have the ability to add products to their cart, place orders, and leave comments and ratings. The administrator can add, edit, and delete products, as well as view and manage all orders. The application supports searching and filtering products by category, size, and price.
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, React Router, Express.js.






ðŸ§  How an Experienced Developer Would Approach It

A professional developer doesnâ€™t jump straight into code â€” they plan architecture first.

Hereâ€™s how theyâ€™d think:

1. Clarify Scope & Choose Stack

Backend: FastAPI (Python) for its speed, simplicity, and async support.

Frontend: React (or Next.js) â€” fits modern SPA structure.

Database: PostgreSQL (production-ready) or SQLite (for local dev).

ORM: SQLAlchemy + Alembic (migrations).

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless auth.

Styling: TailwindCSS or Bootstrap for fast, responsive UI.

(Alternatively, a MERN dev might replace FastAPI with Express, but given your stack, FastAPI + React is perfect.)

2. Design System Architecture

Theyâ€™d split it into 3 layers:

[Frontend]  React / Tailwind
      â†“ REST API Calls (fetch/axios)
[Backend]   FastAPI (auth, CRUD, business logic)
      â†“
[Database]  PostgreSQL / SQLite


Optionally:

Add Admin Panel (could use FastAPI-admin, or a simple React admin dashboard).

Add API integration (like weather, currency, etc.) for extra marks/features.

3. Define Data Models (Database Tables)

A developer would model key entities first â€” e.g.:

User (id, username, email, hashed_password, role)

Post / Product / Ad (id, title, content, author_id, created_at)

Comment (id, post_id, author_id, content, created_at)

Theyâ€™d set up relationships like:

User â†’ Posts (One-to-Many)

Post â†’ Comments (One-to-Many)

4. Plan the API Endpoints

Each entity gets CRUD routes. Example for posts:

Method	Endpoint	Description	Permissions
GET	/posts	List all posts	Public
GET	/posts/{id}	Get one post	Public
POST	/posts	Create post	Registered User
PUT	/posts/{id}	Edit own post	Author or Admin
DELETE	/posts/{id}	Delete post	Author or Admin

Plus:

/register â†’ Create new user

/login â†’ Authenticate user, return JWT

/users/me â†’ Get profile info

5. Implement Role-Based Access

This is Authorization Logic â€” controlling who can do what.
In FastAPI, this is typically handled with dependencies or middleware.

For example:

@router.delete("/posts/{id}")
def delete_post(id: int, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    post = get_post(id)
    if post.author_id != current_user.id and current_user.role != "admin":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Not authorized")
    delete_post_from_db(id)


This ensures:

Normal users can delete their own posts.

Admins can delete anything.

6. Plan Authentication

Authentication verifies who you are. Authorization decides what you can do.

A seasoned developer separates these cleanly.

ðŸ§¾ Typical Auth Flow:

Registration:

User submits username/email/password.

Backend validates input, hashes password, saves user in DB.

Login:

Backend verifies credentials.

If valid â†’ generates JWT token (contains user ID + role).

Token sent back to client â†’ stored in browser (localStorage or cookie).

Protected Routes:

Frontend includes JWT token in Authorization headers.

Backend decodes token and determines the user + role.

Routes verify if the userâ€™s role matches the permission required.

7. Implement Frontend

An experienced dev would use React Router for navigation and context for managing auth.

Frontend pages:

Public: Home, About, Browse Posts

Authenticated: Dashboard, Add/Edit Post, Profile

Admin: Manage Users, Manage Content

Use useEffect to fetch data from the FastAPI backend. Use fetch or axios with JWT headers for authenticated routes.

8. Secure the App

Hash passwords using passlib.

Validate all inputs with Pydantic models.

Use CORS properly.

Implement JWT expiration and refresh if needed.

Restrict admin routes by role checks.

9. API Integration (Optional but Nice)

To add an external API for bonus points:

Weather API on homepage (guest)

Currency conversion API in products page

Location autocomplete API in forms

10. Styling & Deployment

TailwindCSS or Bootstrap for modern design.

Use responsive layouts and mobile-first design.

Deploy backend â†’ Render / Railway

Deploy frontend â†’ Vercel / Netlify

Use environment variables for secrets (JWT key, DB credentials).
